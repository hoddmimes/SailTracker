        <p>
        <i><b>SailTracker</b></i> is primarily a solution for sailors who are planning long distance sailings and who want to share their position with loved ones.
        The sailing track is plotted and shared on a map. The map could and is typically included on a home page for the sailor/boat. A plotted map example could be found for
        <a href="https://hoddmimes.com/sailtracker/map.html?mmsi=265633260"><i>Matilda Sailing</i></a>.
        </p>
    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
            Most boats doing distance sailing are equipped with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system">AIS transponder</a>,
            SailTracker will periodically scrap and record the boat positions from sites receiving and showing the boat AIS transmitted position update.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to have a map setup for a boat, the boat needs to be registered. When registered the boat AIS identification
            <a href="https://mfame.guru/answer-how-does-the-imo-ship-identification-number-aid-ship-monitoring/">(IMO id)</a> is specified
            together mail address, used for registration confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
            When having a registration it is possible to configure;
            <ul style="margin-left:40px">
                <li>how frequently positions should be collected</li>
                <li>enable/disable collection of positions</li>
                <li>Manually enter/remove position entries</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">

        <h2>This is a Hobby Project</h2>
        <p>
            This is a hobby project with no sponsering and no budget. With that comes a few restrictions.</br></br>

            Sites publishing AIS position does not publish all positions. Only position received by land based (AIS) receivers
            are publicly available. Positions received via satellites are not revealed unless having a paid subscription (~ 1000â‚¬/year).
            Currently the solution does not have a subscription and can therefor not collect boat AIS positions being reported via satellites.
            This typically becomes a problem when sailing over open waters where land based AIS received can not receive the AIS signal or when
            sailing in waters where there few AIS land based receivers.

        </p>
        <p>
            However there are mitigation to circumvent this limitation;
            <ul style="margin-left:40px">
                <li>There is a web interface for inputting positions manually. This however require that you in someway
                    note positions when sailing out of reach When coming to a port with Internet the positions can be post entered. </li>
                <li>Many boats are equipped satellite phones having  builtin capability to send a mail with current position. Such mail can be
                sent to a special ShipTracking mail address. SailTracking will parse such mail a register the position for the boat.
                    <i>This functionality is currently not available, missing example data. </i></li>
                <li>An IOS App has been developed (but not yet deployed), the App can record positions which can be uploaded to SailTracking
                when coming to a harbour with Internet.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
